# AIplane feature comparison

This is a feature-by-feature comparison of croit AIplane, LiteLLM and Open WebUI. It is maintained as a standalone product document; the README remains focused on AIplane.

**Checked on 6 October 2026.** AIplane entries use the local `main` implementation revision pinned at the end of this document. LiteLLM and Open WebUI entries describe the public product documentation linked in the source index. For LiteLLM, ✅ means available in the open-source edition; 🟡 Enterprise means the capability requires a paid Enterprise license. Product capabilities change; recheck those sources before using this matrix in a proposal or contract.

## How to read the matrix

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | The feature is directly documented and available in the product. |
| 🟡 | The feature exists with a material limitation, configuration prerequisite, external service, plugin, or edition dependency. For LiteLLM, the note identifies Enterprise-only capabilities. Read the linked evidence. |
| ❌ | The reviewed product documentation explicitly says the feature is unavailable or the product surface does not provide it. This is a scoped product comparison, not a claim that no workaround exists. |
| ⚪ | Not established by the reviewed sources. Treat this as unknown, not as a product gap. |
| — | Not applicable to the product's role in this row. |

“Partial” is not a score. It means that the feature's scope or operating conditions differ. A green LiteLLM mark means its OSS edition; it does not include Enterprise capabilities. A green mark does not mean the implementations are equivalent in quality, scale, security posture, or support. The matrix compares documented product behavior, not marketing claims, and does not infer a feature from a protocol alone.

## What the comparison says

AIplane's strongest position is the combination of a user-facing AI workspace, a governed application gateway, and a business-agent lifecycle in one self-hosted product. The most distinctive documented areas are browser control in a user's own browser, agent publication to a website or A2A channel, repeatable tests before publication, durable human decisions in an inbox, and version-matched documentation shipped with each installation.

AIplane is behind LiteLLM on documented provider breadth, the standalone Python SDK, the batch API surface, broad third-party logging/observability integrations, Terraform deployment modules, and documented multi-replica scaling. Those are concrete gaps, not wording problems. AIplane's documented deployment topology is one application replica; do not position it as horizontally scalable today.

Open WebUI documents stronger end-user collaboration and chat customization in areas such as shared channels, multi-model side-by-side chats, a centralized file manager, and user-selectable local-password authentication. AIplane's advantage is deeper integration between employee chat, application/API governance, and business-agent lifecycle controls. The products overlap substantially in chat, knowledge retrieval, tools, voice and image workflows; check each row's conditions before calling them equivalent.

Browser control needs a narrow definition. AIplane's documented extension acts in the user's existing, authenticated browser. Open WebUI has adjacent browser and desktop capabilities, but its official Chrome-extension repository is archived and marked deprecated at the revision checked here; it points users to the separate desktop app. The reviewed current product sources do not establish that the desktop app controls the same authenticated browser tab. That is why the matrix marks the exact maintained-extension feature as absent while marking broader browser automation as partial. This is a specific AIplane advantage in the current comparison, not a claim that no Open WebUI community add-on or third-party extension can do similar work.

The marks do not establish comparative performance, security quality, or total cost. Those require deployment-specific tests, threat models and pricing evidence. “No” applies only to the named capability and documented product surface; it does not mean the vendor could not add it or that an extension could not approximate it.

AIplane's GDPR and NDA pool flags are operator declarations. They do not inspect a provider's contracts or certify compliance. LiteLLM OSS already includes virtual keys, user/team controls, budgets, spend tracking, routing, and request/response logging. Its SSO is free for up to five users; SCIM, organization/team-scoped delegated administration, team-member permission customization, model-specific budgets per key, selected built-in moderation integrations, key/team-scoped guardrails, secret managers, automated virtual-key rotation, IP allowlists, team-specific logging controls, and multi-region deployment are documented as Enterprise capabilities. This distinction matters: the matrix does not imply that LiteLLM has no access control in OSS; it separates baseline controls from paid enterprise governance. Open WebUI's feature marks describe the documented self-hosted product and can still depend on configuration or connected services.

## Evidence sources

AIplane sources link to this repository's user and operator documentation. LiteLLM and Open WebUI sources link to their official public documentation. The source keys are deliberately reusable so a maintainer can update a page without repeating long URLs in every table row.
