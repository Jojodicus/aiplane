# Grant resources and share agent access

An agent's **resource grants** control what its principal may use. Its **shares** control which people may manage it or respond to waiting work. Configuring one does not configure the other.

You need agent-management permission and write access to change grants or shares. The server verifies resource grant authority when a grant is made; a manager may grant only resources they hold. A new agent starts with no grants.

## Grant the resources an agent uses

1. Open `/agents/<id>` → **Setup** → advanced → **Grants**.
2. Choose a resource kind and select/enter its reference from the available resource catalog.
3. Add the grant. Inspect the resulting kind/reference/granted-by row.
4. In Setup, select that resource in the spec where the task needs it.
5. Save and test. Publish validation checks required grants for the configured resources.

The grant kinds are `model`, `tool`, `connector`, `skill` and `rag_collection`, as offered by the agent resource catalog. Use real catalog references. Model choice reuses the same models, aliases and automatic routes as the rest of AIplane; it is not a separate pool/tier model selection.

Granting a tool permits its use by the principal; selecting it in `main.tools` makes it part of that agent's intended behavior. A knowledge collection grant concerns the corpus; the agent also needs a suitable retrieval tool. A skill grant concerns the installed bundle; the agent selects it in `main.skills`.

Revoke removes the selected grant. Grants are not versioned with the spec: changing a live version or restoring an older one still uses today's grants. Missing grants can therefore affect a previously working published version.

## Configure tool approval policy

Open advanced **Edit** and expand the selected tool's settings. Set `permission` to `always_allow` or `always_ask`, or leave it unset for default policy. Configure `approval_timeout` through the supported spec editor when a task needs an explicit deadline.

`always_ask` creates a persisted turn suspension before the permitted tool call executes. The waiting card includes the tool and its arguments/preview where available. Approving one call is separate from changing the agent's permanent grant. [Inbox handling](run-observe.md#answer-waiting-work) explains who can respond and what expiry means.

Bound tool arguments come from configured constants/state rather than letting the model freely replace those inputs. Use a trusted state slot for an input that depends on verified identity. Test both accepted and refused paths before publishing.

## Share with managers or responders

1. Open **Settings → Sharing** (`/agents/<id>?tab=settings&sub=sharing`).
2. Choose user or group and the access level.
3. Search for the actual subject and select a returned result. Search begins from two characters; the form does not expose the whole user roster.
4. Add. Inspect the table, then change access or revoke a share when needed.

| Access | Intended use |
|---|---|
| `read` | Inspect agent configuration and its conversations |
| `write` | Manage agent configuration and access |
| `respond` | Answer authorized waiting inbox items |

Read and write recipients must be agent managers because those rights expose the spec and visitor conversations. Respond access can be granted to users/groups without builder permission. The server rejects a change that would remove the final write share. An error states the missing requirement; changing the browser form cannot bypass it.

Share access is sensitive because it can expose visitor conversation content. Choose the narrow access needed for a responder, and review the existing table after each change.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Grant refused | Manager's own rights to that resource and agent write access |
| Spec lists a tool but run cannot use it | Real tool ID, principal grant and tool availability |
| Older live version fails after rollback | Current grants; rollback does not restore them |
| Share subject not offered | Search length, actual user/group and server eligibility |
| Read/write share refused | Recipient's `can_manage_agents` permission |
| Respond-only person cannot open builder | Expected separation of responder and manager access |
| Cannot revoke writer | At least one write share must remain |
