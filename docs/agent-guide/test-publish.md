# Test and publish an agent

Testing examines the saved draft or a selected published snapshot. Publication creates a numbered immutable snapshot and makes it live. Use testing to verify routes, permissions and actual answers before a visitor depends on them.

You need agent-management permission and access to the agent; editing test cases or publishing requires write access. The model, tools, connectors and collections used by a test must be available to its principal.

## Try the saved draft

1. Open `/agents/<id>?tab=try&sub=test`.
2. Save pending draft changes when prompted.
3. Start a conversation and send representative visitor messages.
4. Inspect the streamed answer and stopped-turn debug view.
5. Answer any waiting approval, secure input or human-handoff card using the offered controls.
6. Use New conversation when the next scenario requires clean state.

The test chat executes the agent's tools as its actual principal. It is not a dry-run tool simulator: take real external writes into account when choosing test scenarios. The output filter may replace an answer after the turn finishes; the refreshed transcript shows what the visitor would receive.

Debug is manager-visible and helps inspect state, gates and routes. A selected earlier turn can be inspected separately from the latest one. A paused turn needs its answer or expiry before it can finish; sending another message is not approval of a waiting tool.

## Add repeatable test cases

Open **Try it → Tests** (`?tab=try&sub=tests`).

1. Add a named case.
2. Write its script of visitor messages. Add trusted state writes where the scenario explicitly requires that writer.
3. Define deterministic expectations for the result.
4. Optionally add a quality rubric.
5. Save. Choose the saved draft or a published version and run the suite.
6. Inspect each case report and history; edit or delete cases as the real requirements change.

Each case runs in an isolated test conversation. The editor can express expectations for gate openness and missing state, selected route, sub-agent outcomes, tool outcomes, bound values, answer contains/does-not-contain text, output-filter result and whether the run finished.

Reports separate **Goal**, **Plan** and **Action**. The optional rubric is judged by a model and displayed separately; it does not change deterministic pass/fail. A green result proves the tested scripts and expectations, not every possible visitor conversation.

## Require passing tests before publication

Set `publish.require_passing_tests` when publication must be gated by the suite. The advanced Settings form exposes this checkbox.

The publication guard requires a nonempty suite and the newest draft run to pass for the exact current draft and current suite. Changing either makes that prior run stale. A run against an older published version does not satisfy a draft publication gate. Rerun the suite after the final change.

## Publish a version

1. Save the final draft and resolve blocking issues.
2. Run its test suite if required by policy.
3. Use Publish in the agent header or **Settings → Versions** (`?tab=settings&sub=versions`).
4. Confirm the numbered version is marked live.
5. Test the intended caller, such as the website widget, against the published version.

Publication validates the spec at the publish stage, including required resource references and grants. The Versions pane lists blocking issues with spec paths. Draft validation deliberately permits some incomplete setup; a saved draft therefore need not be publishable.

The version list records publisher/time and expandable snapshot JSON. To return production callers to an older snapshot, use its Make live action with confirmation. This changes the live pointer; it does not restore old grants, connectors or external data. Verify those current dependencies after changing the live version.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Test uses old instructions | Saved draft and pending changes |
| Test pauses indefinitely | Waiting card, answer rights and expiry |
| Test produced an external side effect | Tests use real granted tools |
| Rubric passed but suite failed | Deterministic Goal/Plan/Action failures; rubric is separate |
| Passing suite does not unlock Publish | Draft/suite changed, latest draft run stale, or empty suite |
| Published agent behaves differently | Live snapshot, current grants and caller state |
| Older snapshot fails after Make live | Today's grants and dependencies |
