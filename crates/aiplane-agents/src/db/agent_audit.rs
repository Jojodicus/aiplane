//! The agent activity log (`docs/agents.md`, "What #111 built"): an
//! append-only, hash-chained record of everything done to or by a system
//! principal, in the `agent_audit` table.
//!
//! **Two kinds of writer, one insert.** A management change (a grant, a
//! share, a publish) is recorded with [`append`] on the caller's own
//! transaction, naming its actor ([`NewEvent::by`]), so the change can never
//! exist without its event. A run event (a model exchange, a tool call, a
//! gate) is recorded with [`append_now`], which takes the database's write
//! lock for exactly one event. Both end in [`append`], the only `INSERT`
//! into the table; the runtime reaches it
//! through `aiplane_runtime::agents::audit`, which bounds the wait and fails
//! a run closed when an event cannot be written.
//!
//! **Chains.** Every event belongs to one chain: the conversation it happened
//! in (`conversation:<root session>`, sub-agent runs below it included), or,
//! outside any conversation, its agent (`agent:<principal>`). [`append`]
//! finds the conversation from the event's own session (`at.session_id`),
//! following a child session's parent turn up to the root, so no writer
//! picks a chain. Within a chain
//! events are numbered from 1 (`seq`), and each stores the hash of the one
//! before it (`prev_hash`) and its own `hash`: HMAC-SHA256 over its canonical
//! JSON ([`StoredEvent::canonical`]), which covers every column, under a key
//! derived from the gateway's at-rest key ([`install_key_ring`]), so the
//! database alone cannot forge a consistent chain. Each turn's end anchors
//! its conversation's head in the agent's own chain ([`anchor_conversation`]),
//! so a cut tail or a deleted conversation chain shows too. [`verify`] walks
//! the chains and reports the first link that does not hold, and an event
//! outside every chain as one inserted behind the gateway's back.
//!
//! **No foreign keys** (`migrations/0077_agent_builder.sql`): the log
//! outlives the principal, the acting user and the conversation, until the
//! retention sweep removes whole conversation chains ([`sweep_conversation_chains`]).
