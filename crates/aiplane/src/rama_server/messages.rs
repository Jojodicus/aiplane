//! `POST /v1/messages` — the Anthropic Messages API, served by the same
//! pipeline as `/v1/chat/completions`.
//!
//! This is what lets Claude Code (and any other Anthropic-format client) run
//! against the gateway: point `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` here, hand it a `gwk_…`
//! token, and it talks to whatever model the operator has configured — with
//! the gateway's routing, per-token model allowlists, rate limits, usage
//! accounting and tool loop all applying unchanged, because *none of that is
//! reimplemented here*. This module is the format edge and nothing else:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Anthropic request  ──[anthropic::request]──▶  OpenAI request
//!                                                      │
//!            (the existing routing / limits / tool loop / usage path)
//!                                                      │
//!   Anthropic response ◀─[anthropic::response]──  OpenAI response
//!   Anthropic SSE      ◀─[AnthropicSink]────────  OpenAI SSE
//! ```
//!
//! ## Gateway tools
//!
//! An Anthropic-format client brings its own tools — Claude Code brings a
//! dozen — and the gateway's tool loop already knows how to split a turn
//! between the tools it owns and the ones the client owns. So the behaviour
//! here is the same as on `/v1/chat/completions`: gateway tools are merged in
//! only when the caller's token has tool use enabled (off by default), in
//! which case the gateway runs its own tools server-side, invisibly, and
//! hands client-owned calls back for the client to run. With tool use off,
//! this endpoint is pure translation.
//!
//! ## Token counting
//!
//! `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` is answered by asking the *serving backend*
//! to tokenize the translated request — vLLM exposes `POST /tokenize`, which
//! runs the model's own chat template over the messages and tool definitions
//! and returns an exact count.
//!
//! A backend without that endpoint gets a `404` rather than a guess: the
//! client then counts context from the `usage` figures on real responses,
//! which is also exact. Estimating from character counts was the other option,
//! and a confidently wrong number driving a client's compaction decisions is
//! worse than no number at all.
