//! Tool injection + tool-call loop for `/v1/chat/completions`.
//!
//! Algorithm (also described in docs/tools-rbac.md):
//! 1. Compute the user's allowed-tool set (intersect role grants with the
//!    tool registry).
//! 2. If empty, skip everything — let the proxy stream the body through.
//! 3. Otherwise:
//!    - Parse the request body; **union** the user's tool defs with any
//!      `tools` the client sent (de-dupe by `function.name`).
//!    - Forward the modified body to the upstream **non-streaming**, so we
//!      can inspect `tool_calls`.
//!    - If the response carries `tool_calls` for gateway-registered tools
//!      *and only those*: execute them concurrently (bounded), append
//!      `role: "tool"` messages, and loop.
//!    - If the turn carries any client-owned tool_call (a tool the client
//!      supplied, or any name we don't own), return the final response
//!      as-is so the client executes its tools and re-submits. This holds
//!      even when the same turn also called a gateway tool: the client
//!      owns the message history on this path, so we can't run ours and
//!      yield mid-turn without dropping or orphaning the client's calls.
//!    - If no tool_calls at all, return the final assistant message.
//! 4. Hard bound: [`RoundBudget`]. The last round the budget allows is a
//!    *final round* ([`prepare_final_round`]): the model is told its tools are
//!    spent and asked to answer from what it gathered, and the request ends in
//!    a normal completion carrying the [`BUDGET_SIGNAL_FIELD`] signal instead
//!    of an error. A model that calls a tool anyway gets one *closing round*
//!    with the tools withheld ([`prepare_closing_round`]); only when that also
//!    yields no text does the request fail, with
//!    [`LoopError::ToolBudgetExhausted`].
//!
//! Streaming caveat: this path always returns non-streaming. If the client
//! requested `stream: true` and the user has any allowed tools, we still
//! produce a JSON response. Re-issuing the final round with `stream: true`
//! is a follow-up that has not been done.
