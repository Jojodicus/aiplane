//! What sets a person's turn apart from an agent's run, in one place.
//!
//! The round loop in [`super::run_one_turn`] is the same for both: it asks the
//! [`TurnPolicy`] for the leading system message, the round's tool offer, the
//! pools, budget and injection scan, and how the turn ends, and never asks
//! whether it is running an agent. See docs/architecture.md
//! (`openai_driver/turn_policy.rs`) and docs/agents.md → "`RunProfile`".
//!
//! An enum rather than a trait object: the set is closed (a turn acts for a
//! person or is an agent's run, exactly as [`crate::agent_run::Actor`] says),
//! the agent variant only borrows the [`AgentRun`] the driver already holds,
//! and the methods are async — a `dyn` policy would need boxing and
//! `async_trait` lifetimes for no extension anyone can make. A third kind of
//! turn is a new variant here, not an edit to the loop.
