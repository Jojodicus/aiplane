//! The gateway's request runtime: the tool API, the shared state handles, and
//! the workers that drive a turn.
//!
//! - [`server::tools`] — the `Tool` trait, `ToolContext`, the registry, the
//!   catalog, the round-loop runner, the MCP connection manager, the sandbox
//!   client. Implementations live in `aiplane-tools`, above this crate.
//! - [`server::state`] / [`rama_server::state`] — `AppState` and the `RamaState`
//!   that wraps it. This is the layer that ties the whole world together, which
//!   is why it sits above both `aiplane-core` and `aiplane-features`.
//! - [`agents`] — the agent spec layout and its validator (`docs/agents.md`).
//! - [`budget`] — what one run may spend: rounds, seconds, tokens.
//! - [`finish`] — the completion contract a non-interactive run ends by.
//! - [`suspend`] — durable pause and resume of a turn at a tool call that
//!   waits for a decision.
//! - [`openai_driver`] — the streaming chat-completion driver, plus the
//!   background workers that need state: `scheduled`, `webhooks`, `compaction`,
//!   `headless`.
//!
//! `aiplane-tools` and `aiplane-api` both depend on this and on nothing of each
//! other, so a tool edit and a page edit stay independent.
